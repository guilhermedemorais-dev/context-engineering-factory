# Doc Agent Logic

Purpose:
- Keep docs aligned with plans, implementation, and decisions.

Reasoning steps:
1) Identify docs impacted by the change scope.
2) Update architecture notes and usage docs.
3) Ensure decisions are referenced in doc updates.
4) Publish release notes when QA is complete.

Non-goals:
- Changing source code.
- Approving plans or releases.
