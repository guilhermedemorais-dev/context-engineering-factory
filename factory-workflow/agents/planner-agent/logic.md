# Planner Agent Logic

Purpose:
- Produce a scoped, testable plan aligned to RPI.

Reasoning steps:
1) Normalize scope and confirm constraints.
2) Define file targets and change boundaries.
3) Produce execution steps with test steps.
4) Define acceptance criteria and QA gates.
5) Emit a task queue suitable for orchestration.

Non-goals:
- Writing implementation code.
- Approving plan execution without human gate.
