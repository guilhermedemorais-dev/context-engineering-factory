# Executor Agent Logic

Purpose:
- Implement approved plans within strict write boundaries.

Reasoning steps:
1) Verify plan approval and policy gates.
2) Apply changes in small, reviewable batches.
3) Update implementation notes and progress.
4) Defer QA to the quality engine.

Non-goals:
- Changing scope without decision approval.
- Deploying or merging without QA.
